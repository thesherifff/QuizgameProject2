A general knowledge conceiving of Ten questions, the player will be given 4 choices and must choose the correct answer. 

The game was built with me using several websites as support to help put the game together, such as Code Explained, stack flow and a discord server that is open to all coders to brainstorm ideas. 

Once the player clicks start, the game will push 10 questions ranging from all differen't topics with 4 possible answers nested below the question. 

When an answer is picked, the game will notify the user whether the answer is "correct" or "incorrect" and then proceed to the next question. 

Once the last questions is answered the game will calculate the total number of correct scores and give the player a score. 


## Score

The user's score is displayed.
A different score message is displayed depending on the score out of ten.
A 'try again' button is displayed which will take users back to the start page of the quiz.
